# mentor-student-socketApp

mentor&student app to solve code questions.âŒ¨

## About the project
The project was written in two days and included a variety of technologies -
The files were compiled using gulp file and webpack.
For the streaming and passing the data and the board as a game I used 'Websocket'.

### Technologys:
#### front:
- React
- HTML
- CSS
The client side was very comfortable to build with React because of
the States changes and controling the data.
#### back:
- Node.JS
- Websocket
- Express
- MySQL
- Redux
